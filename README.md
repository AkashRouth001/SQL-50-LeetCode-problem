# [1757 - Recyclable and Low Fat Products](https://leetcode.com/problems/recyclable-and-low-fat-products/)

## Table: Products


| Column Name | Type    |
--------------|-----------
| product_id|int|
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |

|  Field | Type |
|-------|-----|
| ID  | NUMBER |
| NAME | VARCHAR2(17)   |
| COUNTRY CODE  | VARCHAR2(3)  |
| DISTRICT |  VARCHAR2(20) |
| POPULATION | NUMBER |

product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
low_fats is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
recyclable is an ENUM (category) of types ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.

## Problem Statement

Write a solution to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example:

### Example 1:

**Input:**  
Products table:  


| product_id  | low_fats | recyclable |  
-------------|----------|------------
| 0           | Y        | N          |  
| 1           | Y        | Y          |  
| 2           | N        | Y          |  
| 3           | Y        | Y          |  
| 4           | N        | N          |  


**Output:**  

 
| product_id  |  
--------------|
| 1           |  
| 3           |  


**Explanation:**  
Only products 1 and 3 are both low fat and recyclable.

## ANSWER
```sql
SELECT product_id  FROM Products
WHERE (low_fats = 'Y') AND (recyclable = 'Y');
```

# [584 - Find Customer Referee](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-customer-referee)

## Table: Customer

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| referee_id  | int     |

id is the primary key column for this table.  
Each row of this table indicates the id of a customer, their name, and the id of the customer who referred them.

## Problem Statement

Write a solution to find the names of the customers that are **not referred** by the customer with `id = 2`.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example:

### Example 1:

**Input:**  
Customer table:  

| id | name | referee_id |
|----|------|------------|
| 1  | Will | null       |
| 2  | Jane | null       |
| 3  | Alex | 2          |
| 4  | Bill | null       |
| 5  | Zack | 1          |
| 6  | Mark | 2          |

**Output:**  

| name |
|------|
| Will |
| Jane |
| Bill |
| Zack |

**Explanation:**  
Only `Alex` and `Mark` are referred by the customer with `id = 2`.  
Thus, all other customers (`Will`, `Jane`, `Bill`, `Zack`) are included in the output.

## ANSWER
```sql
SELECT name from Customer
WHERE (not referee_id = 2)
OR (referee_id is null) ;
```
